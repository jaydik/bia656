jdickerson - I added all the files, played around a bit with the exploration

jdickerson - I read the thing, I don't think we should impute, the stores were closed at that time, I'm ok with just predicting. Going to try flat before I try time series.

jdickerson - Did a lot of work, added Matt's work to the repo, messed around with a bunch of trees, I think that the naive version won't get far. Going to have to add additional info using the other dataset.

## TODO:
 - Start faceting to get some more exploration
 - Figure out time series vs flat
 - Use the other data set to first predict Customers then Sales using the custs
